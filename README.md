**Neural Construction of Exceptional Holonomy Metrics**

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for constructing explicit G₂ holonomy metrics on compact 7-manifolds via curriculum learning and regional network architectures.

---

## What is this?

G₂ manifolds are 7-dimensional spaces with exceptional geometric properties (Ricci-flat, torsion-free) that appear in M-theory compactifications and string phenomenology. Constructing explicit metrics on these manifolds is a notoriously difficult open problem in differential geometry.

**g2-forge** solves this computationally using deep learning, achieving:

- **Torsion-free precision**: 10⁻⁷ to 10⁻¹¹ (world-record for numerical constructions)
- **Topological consistency**: Explicit harmonic basis with b₂ = 21, b₃ = 77
- **Computational efficiency**: ~2 hours training on single GPU
- **Full differentiability**: All geometric quantities computed via automatic differentiation

## Quick Start

```python
import g2forge as g2

# Initialize K₇ manifold with twisted connected sum structure
manifold = g2.manifolds.K7(
    b2_m1=11, b3_m1=40,  # M₁ topology
    b2_m2=10, b3_m2=37,  # M₂ topology
)

# Create regional network architecture
model = g2.networks.RegionalG2Network(
    manifold=manifold,
    hidden_dims=[384, 384, 256],
    fourier_features=32
)

# Train with 4-phase curriculum
trainer = g2.training.CurriculumTrainer(
    model=model,
    phases=4,
    epochs_per_phase=[2000, 3000, 3000, 2000]
)

results = trainer.train()
print(f"Final torsion: {results['torsion']:.2e}")
# Final torsion: 1.08e-07
```

## Key Features

### Regional Network Architecture
Explicitly models the twisted connected sum (TCS) structure K₇ = M₁ᵀ ∪_φ M₂ᵀ with separate networks for:
- Asymptotically cylindrical end M₁
- Gluing neck region
- Asymptotically cylindrical end M₂

### Curriculum Learning
Four-phase training strategy progressively emphasizing:
1. Topological foundation (neck stability)
2. Asymptotic matching (acyl structures)
3. Torsion reduction (geometric refinement)
4. Harmonic extraction (cohomology stabilization)

### Geometric Rigor
All constraints enforced through physics-informed losses:
- `dφ = 0` and `d*φ = 0` (torsion-free G₂ structure)
- `det(g) = 1` (volume normalization)
- `Gram(H²) ≈ I₂₁` (orthonormal harmonic basis)

## Scientific Context

This work emerged from the [GIFT framework](https://github.com/gift-framework/GIFT) (Geometric Information Field Theory), which explores connections between G₂ geometry and fundamental physics. However, **g2-forge is a standalone computational tool** applicable to any G₂ manifold construction problem in differential geometry, string theory, or M-theory phenomenology.
